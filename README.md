# Streamer

This project solves the problem of allowing payers of token streams to create streams and fund them after-the-fact.
i.e: first create the stream, and fund it later when funds are available.
For example, Nouns DAO can use [Token Buyer](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer/) with Streamer to acquire stablecoins and fund streams fully on-chain.
